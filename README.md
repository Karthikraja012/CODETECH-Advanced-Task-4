## **Project Overview: Sentiment Analysis on Textual Data**

### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and classify textual data (e.g., tweets, reviews) into positive or negative sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to deliver insights into sentiment trends and evaluate the performance of machine learning models for sentiment classification.

---

### **Scope**
- **Dataset**: A collection of text data such as tweets, product reviews, or feedback.
- **Sentiment Classes**: Binary classification (Positive or Negative sentiments).
- **Deliverable**: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing:
  1. Data preprocessing techniques.
  2. Machine learning model implementation.
  3. Insights and evaluation results.

---

### **Workflow**
#### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Text data is often noisy and unstructured. Preprocessing ensures the data is clean and ready for analysis.
- **Steps:**
  - Removal of special characters, URLs, and numbers.
  - Conversion of text to lowercase for consistency.
  - Stopword removal to eliminate non-informative words.
  - Tokenization and lemmatization to normalize words.

#### **2. Feature Extraction**
- Textual data is converted into a numerical format suitable for machine learning.
- **Method Used**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to capture the importance of words in the text.

#### **3. Model Implementation**
- **Model Chosen**: Multinomial Naive Bayes, a simple yet effective model for text classification tasks.
- **Training and Testing**:
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80%-20%).
  - The model is trained on the TF-IDF features and then tested for performance.

#### **4. Evaluation**
- The model's performance is assessed using:
  - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
  - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Detailed evaluation for each sentiment class.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of prediction errors.

#### **5. Insights**
- The sentiment distribution and model results are analyzed to draw conclusions.
- Examples of misclassified instances are highlighted for error analysis.
